# How to contribute

As this is a side project, I am not able to dedicate full attention to it. Which means that new features and bug fixes may take some time. If you would like to speed up the process, please consider contributing to the project.

## Feature Requests and Bug Reporting

If you have any issues, please create an issue in the github issues section. Please follow the issue template and provide as much information as possible.  In case of bug it is very helpfull if a config or a test case that can reproduce the issue is provided. 

## Code Contributions

If you would like to contribute to the project, please follow the steps below:
1. Create or use an issue describing the change you would like to implement. 
2. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
3. Implement the changes and add unit tests if applicable. Do not change formatting of existing code.
4. Create a pull request to the main branch of the repository. 
5. Pull request message should reference the issue that is being fixed and provide a short description of the changes and have following format depending on the type of the change: 
`(feat/fix/test/chore): <issue title> (#<issue number>)`
6. Keep pull request up to date with the main branch and resolve any code review comments.
