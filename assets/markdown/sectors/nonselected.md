A **Tech Radar** is a tool or framework commonly used in the technology industry to help teams and organizations stay informed about emerging technologies, trends, and best practices. It serves as a visual representation of the technology landscape and helps teams make informed decisions about the tools, languages, frameworks, and methodologies they should adopt.<br><br>

This repository contains ready to use technology radar for your teams to leverage. It can be a starting point for your own radar that can be easily customized to fit your needs and style preferences. Radar was inspired by [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) and [Zalando Tech Radar](https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/). It is built using [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [eg-radar](https://github.com/EdgarsGarsneks/eg-radar)<br><br>

This is a **demo** of the radar. **These blips are configured only for demonstration purpose, there is no analysis behind them.** Contents of the blips **have generic markdown information** and are taken mostly from original technology GitHub documentation.
